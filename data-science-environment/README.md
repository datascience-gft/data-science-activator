# Deploying data science environment

Pre-requisite to build the data science environment is to build the shared
-components infrastructures.

After that please follow the following steps:

### 1) Building Kubernetes Cluster

* Update iam.tf and add your service account file (json) to provider "google
", full directory to the your file shall be added to file("").
```hcl-terraform
provider "google" {
  version = "~> 2.5"
  credentials = file("")
  project     = var.cluster_project_id
  region      = var.region
}
```
* Update variables.tf and add your project_id to the following in default = "":
```hcl-terraform
variable "sharedvpc_project_id" {
  default     = ""
  type = string
}
```

* Run the following commands:

```
    terraform init
    terrafrom plan
    terraform apply
```

### 2) Building JupyterHub

* Go to gcp consul and choose your project.

* Search and select the Kubernetes Cluster that you built in step 1 
(E.g. ds-kubernet-cluster).

* Connect to the cluster by clicking on 'CONNECT', then choose 'Run in Cloud
 Shell'.
 
* A shell window with the a command will be opened, please run the command
 in the shell, the command that you will see is, cluster name, region, and
  project are variables:
```shell script
gcloud container clusters get-credentials ds-kubernet-cluster --region europe-west2 --project activator-kubernetes
```
* Then you need to update the jupyterhub-config.yaml file that exist in the
 package, secretToken needs to be updated to user provided one, please run
  the following command in shell to get you searchToken to be able to update
   the config file.

```shell script
openssl rand -hex 32
```
 
```yaml
proxy:
  secretToken: "7f21fbbf6475f8e92097949aaf2b32cfae21a9ebdd8116a3e772e0422687a3d5"


auth:
  type: dummy
  dummy:
    password: 'juppass'
  whitelist:
    users:
      - user1
      - user2

```

* At this point you need to move both jupyterhub-config.yaml and
 install_juphub.sh files into your cloud shell, then run the following command.
```shell script
./install_juphub.sh jupyterhub-config.yaml
```

* Above command creates the jupyterhub and provide you an IP address to
 connect to Jupyterhub. Current users are dummy users provided in config
  file. In next step you need to set up the users and HTTPS connection.
  
* Instruction to set up user authentication for jupyterhub is available in:

    https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/administrator/authentication.html

* Please follow the instruction in the following link to set up HTTPS,
